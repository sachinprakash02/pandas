# pandas
This repository contains all the essential methods,functions and features of python's pandas library
pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive. It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python. Additionally, it has the broader goal of becoming the most powerful and flexible open source data analysis / manipulation tool available in any language. It is already well on its way toward this goal.

pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:

-Tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet
-Ordered and unordered (not necessarily fixed-frequency) time series data.
-Arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels
-Any other form of observational / statistical data sets. The data actually need not be labeled at all to be placed into a pandas data s     structure
